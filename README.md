Includes HTerrain and GodotDetour (MIT). Large chunks of the Godot Detour demo are incorporated into world.gd. The code (not assets) are MIT licensed.

Assets are credited by folder and licensed as noted. My own assets are in the Eamonn folder.

I've built a binary for GodotDetour for Linux and Windows but for other platforms you'll need to build it.

go into godotdetour, set up the native library as described in its docs: https://github.com/TheSHEEEP/godotdetour
