> Obstacles are intended as a last resort option for constantly moving objects that cannot be re(baked) to a navigation mesh efficiently. This node also only works if RVO processing is being used.

This suggests that the norm is to rebake the nav mesh. The move, then, is probably to rebake the mesh when buildings are destroyed.

We can bake navigation mesh at runtime with navigation region.bake_navigation_mesh

It may be profitable to break the map into multiple navigation regions so that we don't need to do large rebakes when buildings are destroyed.
